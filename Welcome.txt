Welcome to the QIB Dockerised learning environment to learn how
to use Mothur for 16s analysis from the command-line.
Data and tutorial notes from Schloss lab Miseq SOP and the cgiar
Mothur tutorials.
This environment will run on any linux machine running Docker 
Host (or on Windows PC & Macs running Docker Toolbox (Kitematic)).
You will need to click on home folder, enable volumes and map this 
to a local directory on your computer.
Then you will need to run a script ( /scripts/get_data.sh ) to copy 
the data files etc to your home directory.
